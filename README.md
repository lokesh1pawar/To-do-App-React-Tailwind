# Dynamic To-Do List Application ðŸš€

This is a beautifully designed dynamic to-do list application built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**. It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with features like adding, completing, deleting, and filtering tasks. The application also persists data in local storage to ensure tasks are retained after a page refresh.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks**: Quickly add new tasks using a simple input field.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Toggle task completion by clicking on the task.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Filter Tasks**: View tasks by categories - All, Completed, or Pending.
- **Data Persistence**: Tasks are saved in local storage to survive page refreshes.
- **Responsive Design**: A clean, responsive UI styled with Tailwind CSS.
